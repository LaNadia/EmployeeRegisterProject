Hello! 
This is my first project on React.
Actually, it is a training project.

How to view?
npm start to open a localhost <3 


There are some  things enlivened: for example, you can add a new employee (both forms are required, name > 3 symbols, only numbers in 'paycheck'form; 
tap cookie to give a bonus to the employee chosen, tap trash-ico to delete, tap an employee`s name to give him a promotion (a star appears). 
There are also some filters (please be attentive - the filter where you print names is case sensitive.)


Well, i think this short overview is enough, now look at the screens!
